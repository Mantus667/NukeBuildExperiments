# CommitLinter

This repository uses a commit linter that is installed via npm.
The chosen solution is: [git-commit-msg-linter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-commit-msg-linter).

To use it you have to install it via `npm install`.
It forces better commit messages by enforcing rules based on the commit rules of Angular.
